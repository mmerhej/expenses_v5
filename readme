Here are a few pointers to make running this project easier
1- install xampp as it will install mySQL, Apache and FTP servers without the need for individual installs
access the console with the following command:
sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux.run
running as super user will require root password
2- in the console run the mySQL serve
3- create a new database and import expenses.sql
4- change root password for phpMyadmin to '123' for a quick connection to database
5- open netbeans and run the project
